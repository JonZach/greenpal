This is a personal capstone project for the front end portion of the Nashville Software School bootcamp.

This app will allow vendors to sign up and save their information. Upon sign up a vendor will receive a "Vendor Code" that is automatically generated.

Homeowners will then be able to enter specific Vendor Codes to schedule service with a particular vendor.

A calendar API will then update the homeowner and vendor's schedules respectively.
